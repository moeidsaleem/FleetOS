const response = await fetch('/api/drivers/alert-call', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    driverId: 'driver-uuid',
    reason: 'Poor Performance',
    message: 'Driver performance metrics are below standards',
    driverName: 'John Doe',
    phoneNumber: '+971501234567',
    currentScore: 0.65
  }),
})

const result = await response.json()
```

## AI Agent Behavior

### System Prompt Generation

The system automatically generates contextual prompts based on:
- Driver name and current performance score
- Specific reason for the call
- Detailed message about the issue
- Company policies and tone guidelines

### Conversation Flow

1. **Professional Greeting**: AI introduces itself as Mr. Nice Drive representative
2. **Issue Discussion**: Addresses the specific concern respectfully
3. **Performance Review**: Mentions current score and areas for improvement
4. **Active Listening**: Asks open-ended questions to understand driver's perspective
5. **Constructive Feedback**: Provides actionable advice and support
6. **Positive Closure**: Ends with clear next steps and encouragement

### Conversation Guidelines

The AI agent is programmed to:
- Maintain a respectful, professional tone
- Focus on improvement rather than punishment
- Be empathetic and understanding
- Provide specific, actionable advice
- Keep calls to 3-5 minutes maximum
- Remain calm if drivers become defensive
- Offer support and resources for improvement

## Phone Number Formatting

The system automatically formats phone numbers for international calling:
- Removes non-digit characters
- Adds UAE country code (+971) if no country code is present
- Supports other international formats

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Configuration**: Ensure all ElevenLabs environment variables are set
2. **Invalid Phone Number**: Check phone number format and country code
3. **Agent Not Found**: Verify Agent ID is correct
4. **Call Failed**: Check Twilio integration and phone number status

### Error Responses

The API returns detailed error messages for troubleshooting:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "ElevenLabs configuration is missing. Please check environment variables."
}
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Alert Records

All calls are logged in the database with:
- Alert type, priority, and status
- Reason and message content
- Timestamps for creation and completion
- ElevenLabs conversation ID and Twilio call SID

### Call Tracking

Monitor call success rates and driver responses through:
- Dashboard analytics
- Alert history in driver profiles
- Database queries on `alert_records` table

## Best Practices

### When to Use AI Calls

- Performance scores below 70%
- Multiple missed trips or cancellations
- Customer complaints requiring immediate attention
- Safety violations or policy breaches
- Extended periods of inactivity

### Call Timing

- Avoid early morning or late evening calls
- Consider driver's time zone and work schedule
- Allow reasonable time between calls to the same driver

### Follow-up Actions

- Document call outcomes in driver notes
- Schedule follow-up calls if needed
- Provide additional training or resources
- Monitor performance improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Issues

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   echo $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
   echo $ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID
   echo $ELEVENLABS_AGENT_PHONE_NUMBER_ID
   ```

2. **Verify Agent Configuration**:
   - Audio format set to Î¼-law 8000 Hz
   - Authentication enabled
   - Overrides enabled for system prompt and first message

3. **Test API Connection**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/user" \
     -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

### Call Issues

1. **No Audio**: Check audio format settings in agent configuration
2. **Call Drops**: Verify Twilio integration and phone number status
3. **Wrong Language**: Ensure agent is configured for appropriate language
4. **Poor Quality**: Check internet connection and audio settings

## Security Considerations

- Store API keys securely in environment variables
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper authentication for admin endpoints
- Monitor API usage to prevent abuse
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Log all call activities for audit purposes
